## Project Overview

Klinoff Travels is a travel planning application that allows users to search for flights, hotels, weather information, and local attractions for their travel destinations. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. They can search for flights between two destinations, find hotels in their destination city, get weather forecasts for their travel dates, and discover popular attractions in their destination city. Users can save and manage their travel itineraries, including flights, hotels, and attractions. The application will use various APIs to provide flight search, hotel search, weather information, and local attractions data. The frontend will be built using React.js, the backend will be built using Firebase Functions or Node.js, and the database will be Firebase Firestore or MongoDB. User authentication will be handled using Firebase Authentication. The application will be styled using SCSS/Sass preprocessor.
